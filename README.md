=============

An experiment in modelling HTTP & creating an HTTP client in Scala.

Primarily this is a learning tool for me to consolidate my understanding
of the HTTP specification & Scala & experiment with some ideas I have about
the rich modelling of small types & composing HTTP request / response handling
using the decorator pattern.

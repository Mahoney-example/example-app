lidalia-http-2
=============

An experiment in modelling HTTP & creating an HTTP client in Scala.

Primarily this is a learning tool for me to consolidate my understanding
of the HTTP specification & Scala & experiment with some ideas I have about
the rich modelling of small types & composing HTTP request / response handling
using the decorator pattern.

To build you will need SNAPSHOT builds of:

 - [lidalia-lang](https://github.com/Mahoney/lidalia-lang)
 - [scala-module](https://github.com/Mahoney/scala-module)

Then:
```
git clone git@github.com:Mahoney/lidalia-http-2.git; cd lidalia-http-2; mvn install
```
